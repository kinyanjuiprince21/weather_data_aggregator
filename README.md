## Weather Data Aggregator

This is a webscraping that currently scrapes only air quality for Nairobi area. It does the averaging of the air quality data and stores in a json file. I have set it as a cron job to be averaging the daily air quality data at midnight.

### How to run it
Open the project in an IDE and execute the schedular.js,
or you can run it using node like this:<br>
<code>node schedular.js</code>
